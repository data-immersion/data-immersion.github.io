# My Experiments with Data Engineering

### What is Data Engineering?

Data Engineering, as the name suggests, it's going to deal with large volumes of Data. Data Engineers involve in creating and maintaining a system that 
- collect
- store &
- process 
large volumes of Data.

The Primary focus will be on collecting the Data and analysing it, making sure that Data is reliable, accessable, clean, usable for 
- Business Users
- Data Analysts
- Data Scientists
- Company Stakeholders

Must Need skills for Data Engineer: 
- Programming: Experience in languages like Python, Java, Scala, and SQL.
- Database Management: Knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases. Eg: MongoDb, PostgreSQL, etc...
- Big Data Technologies: Experience with Hadoop, Spark, and other Big Data frameworks.
- Cloud Platforms: Primary Knowledge with cloud services from Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS, etc...
- Version Control: Knowledge in Git and other version control systems Eg: Github, Gitlab, etc...
- Data Modeling: Designing data models that support business requirements and analytics.

### Steps involved in Data Engineering: 
- Data Collection: 
    * Gather Data from multiple sources, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, APIs, web scraping, IoT devices, and third-party data  providers.
    * You can use tools such as Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming,and many more.

- Data Storage: 
    * Design and Implement data storage solutions, such as Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Databases, to store large volumes of data efficiently.
        - Eg for Data Warehouses: Google BigQuery, and Snowflake etc
        - Eg for Data Lakes: Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, and Azure Data Lake etc
        - Eg for Databases: Both relational and non-relational such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDb, Cassandra etc

- Data Processing: 
        * This stage involves in transforming raw data into usable format through 
                        - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process
                        - Batch process
                        - Stream Process
            which include cleaning, aggregating, and enriching data.

- Data Pipeline Management:
    * This stage involves in Monitoring and Orchestrating workflows, ensure data pipelines run reliably and on time, to track health and performance of data pipelines to quickly identify and resolve issues

- Data Quality:
    * This stage involves in Validating and Cleansing by implementing rules to validate data integrity and consistency during and after ETL processes and removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing data formats.
    * You can use tools like Great Expectations and Talend to achieve this. These tools provide you automated scripts which helps you in ensuring Data Quality.

- Optimization:
    * Performance Tuning: Enhancing the efficiency of data storage and query performance by indexing, partitioning, and using caching mechanisms.
    * Scalability: Designing systems that can scale horizontally (adding more machines) or vertically (adding more resources to a machine) to    handle increasing data volumes and processing demands.

### Why do you need to become Data Engineer?
    Everything in this world is 'DATA'

Perks of being a Data Engineer: 
- High Demand
- Good Compensation
- Career Growth
- Foundational Role
    * Data engineering is a foundational role in data science and analytics. 
- Versatility and Variety
    * The role involves working with a wide range of technologies, tools, and data types, which keeps the job interesting and provides continuous learning opportunities.
- Impact on Decision-Making
    * Data engineers enable data-driven decision-making by ensuring that accurate and timely data is available for analysis, leading to better business outcomes.
- Collaborative Work Environment
    * Data engineers often work closely with data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders, fostering a collaborative and interdisciplinary work environment.
- Problem-Solving
    * The role involves solving complex problems related to data architecture, scalability, and efficiency, which can be intellectually stimulating and satisfying
