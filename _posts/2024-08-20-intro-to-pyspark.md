# Introduction to PySpark

### What is PySpark?

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark. It is an open-source framework. It is designed for processing large datasets across a cluster of computers. PySpark allows Python developers to work with Spark to leverage its high-performance, in-memory data processing capabilities.

        Python + Spark = PySpark


### Key Features of PySpark:

- Support for Various Data Sources -> PySpark can handle a wide range of data formats, such as JSON, Parquet, ORC, and CSV, and can connect to various data storage systems like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Amazon S3, and NoSQL databases like HBase and Cassandra.

- Distributed Computing -> PySpark enables parallel processing on large datasets by distributing the computation across multiple nodes in a cluster. This makes it highly efficient for processing petabytes of data.

- In-Memory Computation ->  PySpark uses in-memory storage and computation, which reduces disk I/O and significantly increases the speed of data processing compared to traditional systems like Hadoop MapReduce.


### Key Components of PySpark:

1) SparkSession: 
    - This is the entry point for using Spark functionality. 
    - We can create DataFrames, execute SQL queries, and manage Spark clusters.

2) RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets): 
    - It is the low-level abstraction for distributed data in Spark. 
    - RDDs are fault-tolerant and can be rebuilt if nodes fail, making them highly resilient. 
    - With this we can achieve fault-tolerance.

3) DataFrame:
    - It is the higher-level abstraction in Spark. It is created on top of RDDs, similar to tables in relational databases.
    - DataFrames allow you to perform operations on structured data, such as SQL queries and aggregations.

4) Transformations:
    - It is the operations on RDDs or DataFrames.
    - Each transformation result in a new RDD/DataFrame (e.g., map(), filter()).
    - It is lazily evaluated (i.e only called upon a action).
    - Meaning they are not executed immediately. Instead, they build a logical plan of the computations to be performed.

5) Actions:
    - It is the operations that trigger execution and return results (e.g., count(), show()).
    - Actions trigger the execution of the transformations

6) PySpark Streaming:
    - Real-time processing of streaming data using Sparkâ€™s micro-batch architecture.


### Why Use PySpark?

- Speed and Scalability -> PySpark can process massive datasets with ease due to its distributed architecture.
- Flexibility -> PySpark supports both batch and real-time data processing (Streaming).
- Ease of Use -> PySpark combines the simplicity of Python with the power of Spark, making it easier to build big data applications.

### Cluster Architecture

PySpark follows a master-slave architecture with components like the Driver and Executors:

1) Driver Program:
- The main process that coordinates the Spark application and is responsible for:
    - Defining the transformations and actions on the data.
    - Creating and managing the SparkContext.
    - Scheduling tasks and distributing them across the worker nodes (executors).

2) Cluster Manager: 
- Coordinates resource allocation and task scheduling for distributed processing. 
- Spark can work with various cluster managers like:

    - Standalone Cluster Manager (default, built-in)
    - Apache YARN (Hadoop)
    - Apache Mesos
    - Kubernetes

3) Executors:
- Worker processes running on cluster nodes that:
    - Execute the tasks assigned by the driver program.
    - Store data in memory or disk for caching and efficient computation.
    - Perform the actual data processing by executing transformations and actions.
